# is example me a aur b dono int the agr ek ya dono floating point hote to answer would
# have been floating point for all of these 5 arithmetic operators

# assignment operator - '='
# similarly we have += , -= , *= , /=
print(type(a%b))

# exponential operator - **
# 5 raised to the power 3 = 5**3
