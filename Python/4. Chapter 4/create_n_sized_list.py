print(a)
# now these 5 places of list can be accessed index wise a[0]=0 same for other
# now we can assign values to array index wise which wasn't possible for empty list.
# To agr append ni karna he but ek specific index pe dalna he to above can be used.

# num of elements in array can be anything also value can be anything.

b=[True,1]*3 # will make [True,1,True,1,True,1]
