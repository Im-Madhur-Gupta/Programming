print("HI there, python doesn't need semicolon")
print("check")
# consecutive print statement start their respective printing form next line

# if we do not want the consecutive prints to print on seperate lines, we do the following -
# print(_____, end="")
print("HI there, python doesn't need semicolon", end="")
print("check")
# if we want printing to be seperated by a space then --> end=" "
print("HI there, python doesn't need semicolon", end=" ")
print("check")

# to print multiline strings through print function, we use " ''' " triple single quote
# example -

print('''My love, my love, my fearless love,
My love will never Die
                          - Lucifer''')

# above multiline string could also have been printed using multiple print commands
